# bhInterview

## Two solutions:
* The bhInterview demonstrates entity framework and connecting to a database.
* The bhInterviewWeb solution demonstrates a website with a model view controller.
* The unit tests are in the bhInterview solution as a seperate project.

I used Visual Studio 2019 to create these projects.
